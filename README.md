## Introduction

**Containerized App Scheduler for NeuroImaging (CASNI)** is a cutting-edge workload management tool designed specifically for the neuroimaging community. With the growing complexity and scale of neuroimaging data, there's a pressing need for efficient, scalable, and reproducible processing pipelines. CASNI harnesses the power of containerization technologies like Docker to address this need, allowing researchers and professionals to run neuroimaging tasks in a modular, isolated, and scalable environment.

### Features

- **Containerized Workflows**: Run neuroimaging workflows inside standardized containers ensuring consistency across various computing environments.
- **Easy Scheduling**: Schedule your neuroimaging tasks seamlessly without the hassle of configuring complex environments.
- **Scalability**: Whether you're processing data from a single patient or a cohort of thousands, CASNI scales according to your needs.
- **Reproducibility**: With containerization, reproduce your results across different platforms without any "it works on my machine" issues.
